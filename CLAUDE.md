Hey bro welcome to the terminal javadocs!

I don't want to micromanage you.

Just a few do's and don'ts:

- Read the README.md to catch up on the project's conventions and guidelines.
- Follow project conventions
- Avoid running build commands, they waste tokens. Ask the user for it.
- Do not commit stuff without checking with the user first. 
- This is a CSS-heavy project so I heavily recommend using the CSS Skill in Claude for pretty much all requests that involve css.

- In short: Building, Testing, Reviewing and Commiting are the user's job, unless they ask.

Thank you for your contributions!
